	abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.
To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension.
We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections:
General description of the technique and why it should work How general are the effects of this technique? 2a. Learning conditions 2b. Student characteristics 2c. Materials 2d. Criterion tasks Effects in representative educational contexts Issues for implementation Overall assessment

The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques.
To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students’ performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique.
Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students’ performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading).
Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Feedback has a powerful influence on learning, but it is also expensive to provide. In large classes, it may even be impossible for instructors to provide individualized feedback. Peer assessment has received attention lately as a way of providing personalized feedback that scales to large classes. Besides these obvious benefits, some researchers have also conjectured that students learn by peer assessing, although no studies have ever conclusively demonstrated this effect. By conducting a randomized controlled trial in an introductory statistics class, we provide evidence that peer assessment causes significant gains in student achievement. The strength of our conclusions depends critically on the careful design of the experiment, which was made possible by a web-based platform that we developed. Hence, our study is also a proof of concept of the high-quality experiments that are possible with online tools.},

The concept quickly hit a nerve. Newport's articles on the topic have been read hundreds of thousands of times and were picked up and promoted by other bloggers and traditional media. Now, in DEEP WORK, Newport explains how to systematically train the mind to focus and reorganize our work lives so that deep work is at the core. He argues why this shift is crucial to stay ahead in a complex information economy. Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions we can make in an increasingly distracted world.},

In the study reported here, we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning. During two sessions occurring 12 hr apart, 40 participants practiced foreign vocabulary until they reached a perfect level of performance. Half of them learned in the morning and relearned in the evening of a single day. The other half learned in the evening of one day, slept, and then relearned in the morning of the next day. Their retention was assessed 1 week later and 6 months later. We found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention. Sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.},

The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

In this research, we test the “brain drain” hypothesis that the mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance. Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making and consumer welfare.},

	abstract = {Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by "success" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. "Statistical significance" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental "cuteness" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.},

	title = {Simpson's {Paradox}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/paradox-simpson/},
	abstract = {Consider the following story:, While no capsul can be good for men and women, yet bad for people, orgood for people while being bad for men and women, the imagined data(see below) on which FIXIT based its recommendations exhibit patternsthat are both arithmetically possible and turn up in actual data sets.While there is nothing paradoxical about the existence of such datafrom the standpoint of arithmetic, they do pose problems for practicaldecision making (e.g., would you want to be treated with Fixit’scapsuls in light of the reported clinical trials?), for heuristicsused in intuitive reasoning about probabilities, for inferences fromdata to causal relations, and more generally, for philosophicalprograms that aim to eliminate or reduce causation to regularities andrelations between probabilities., The arithmetic, on which examples like FIXIT’s ill-judgedrecommendations are based, is unproblematic. In summary it is basedon the fact that, An association between a pair of variables can consistently beinverted in each subpopulation of a population when the population ispartitioned, and conversely, associations in each subpopulation can beinverted when data are aggregated., Call this principle Simpson’s Reversal of Inequalities. Failure torecognise such reversals can lead to the abovementioned pitfalls aboutwhat to do, what to believe, what to infer, and what causes what.Even when actual and possible reversals are recognized, pitfallsremain. On a positive note, once the possibilities of Simpson’sReversals are recognized, they provide a rich resource forconstructing causal models that help to explain many facts that appearat first to be anomolous. Moreover, there is a test called the“back-door criterion” (Pearl 1993) which can be used to helpresolve the question of whether one should base a decision on thestatistics from the aggregate population or from the partitionedsubpopulations., Section 1 provides a brief history of Simpson’s Paradox, a statementand diagnosis of the arithmetical structures that give rise to it, andthe boundary conditions for its occurrence. Section 2 examinespatterns of invalid reasoning that have their sources in Simpson’sParadox and possible ways of countering its effects. A particularlyimportant case where Simpson’s Paradox has been invalidly employed isdiscussed in Section 3. It has been mooted that paradoxical dataprovide counter-examples to the Sure Thing Principle in theories ofrational choice. Why such data appear to provide counter-examples tothe Sure Thing Principle is explained, and the appearance that they doso is dispelled. Section 4 discusses the roles and implications ofparadoxical data for theories of causal inference and for analyses ofcausal relations in terms of probabilities. While the conclusions ofthis section are largely negative, Section 5 illustrates howapparently paradoxical data can support causal models for theevolution of traits that at first appear to be incompatible with asetting in which natural selection disadvantages individuals thatexhibit the traits.},

	shorttitle = {The {GRIMMER} test},
	url = {https://peerj.com/preprints/2400v1/},
	abstract = {GRIMMER (Granularity-Related Inconsistency of Means Mapped to Error Repeats) builds upon the GRIM test and allows for testing whether reported measures of variability are mathematically possible. GRIMMER relies upon the statistical phenomenon that variances display a simple repetitive pattern when the data is discrete, i.e. granular. This observation allows for the generation of an algorithm that can quickly identify whether a reported statistic of any size or precision is consistent with the stated sample size and granularity. My implementation of the test is available at PrePubMed (http://www.prepubmed.org/grimmer) and currently allows for testing variances, standard deviations, and standard errors for integer data. It is possible to extend the test to other measures of variability such as deviation from the mean, or apply the test to non-integer data such as data reported to halves or tenths. The ability of the test to identify inconsistent statistics relies upon four factors: (1) the sample size; (2) the granularity of the data; (3) the precision (number of decimals) of the reported statistic; and (4) the size of the standard deviation or standard error (but not the variance). The test is most powerful when the sample size is small, the granularity is large, the statistic is reported to a large number of decimal places, and the standard deviation or standard error is small (variance is immune to size considerations). This test has important implications for any field that routinely reports statistics for granular data to at least two decimal places because it can help identify errors in publications, and should be used by journals during their initial screen of new submissions. The errors detected can be the result of anything from something as innocent as a typo or rounding error to large statistical mistakes or unfortunately even fraud. In this report I describe the mathematical foundations of the GRIMMER test and the algorithm I use to implement it.},

In light of cognitive psychology theory on costs associated with multitasking, we examined the effects of in-class laptop use on student learning in a simulated classroom. We found that participants who multitasked on a laptop during a lecture scored lower on a test compared to those who did not multitask, and participants who were in direct view of a multitasking peer scored lower on a test compared to those who were not. The results demonstrate that multitasking on a laptop poses a significant distraction to both users and fellow students and can be detrimental to comprehension of lecture content.},

	abstract = {Theories in "soft" areas of psychology lack the cumulative character of scientific knowledge. They tend neither to be refuted nor corroborated, but instead merely fade away as people lose interest. Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible, being a poor way of doing science. Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasialways false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, second-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with zero false negatives.},
